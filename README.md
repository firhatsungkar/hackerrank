# hackerrank progress

### Hackerrank April 29, 2017
create a repo, named "hackerrank" in your personal github account. solve programming problems in hackerrank.com and save them in your newly created repo. use the same naming convention for every problem by using lowercase (such as "Mars Exploration" => "mars-exploration"). The programming problems that you need to solve are:
- [x] Warmup: Solve Me First, also choose 1 other problem from the list.
- [x] Choose 1 problem from "Implementation".
- [ ] Solve "Caesar Cipher and "Pangrams".

### Hackerrank May 20, 2017
(1) All of hackerrank results today should be pushed to your hackerrank repo (same repo with last hackerrank assignment).
(2) Use the same naming convention as previous assignment:

Using lowercase (such as “Mars Exploration” => “mars-exploration”).

(3) The programming problems that you need to solve are:
- [x] Warmup: choose 1 problem.
- [x] Choose 1 problem from “Implementation”.
- [x] Solve “Data Structures” - “Arrays” - “Sparse Arrays” problem.
- [x] Solve “Data Structures” - “Linked Lists” - “Insert a node at a specific position in a linked list”.
Don’t forget to create a simple README.md file to make others understand the purpose of your folders.
